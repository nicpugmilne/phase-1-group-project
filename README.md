# phase-1-group-project
Nicola and Kaegan build a basic web application!

---------------------------------------------------------------
**Requirements:**
- Single HTML page
- 3 unique event-listeners
- One instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc)

**Project Pitch:**
- Our application is intended to be used as an icebreaker. Who doesn't love either quotes, jokes, or goats?
- Upon request, we will present users with a random Kanye West quote using the Kanye Rest API https://kanye.rest/, random jokes from a public Joke API  https://v2.jokeapi.dev/#getting-started, and random goat images from our own json file of curated goat images.
- The joke api serves up jokes with different formats, so we will need to handle the different shapes gracefully. Another challenge will be using a combination of APIs and json server.
- We will use click, keydown, and mouseover events.
- We will iterate through our array of goat images with an easter egg covering the screen in goats (for even more fun)!

**User stories**
- As a user, I can click a button to request a random quote, so that I can share the wisdom with friends.
- As a user, I can click a button to request a random joke, so that I can share laughter with friends.
- As a user, I can click a button to see a random goat image, which should make me smile.
- As a user, I can request to see a new quote, joke, or goat, which should replace the quote/joke/goat currently displayed on the page.
- As a user, I can press any key to start covering the screen with goats, so that I see many goats at once!
- As a user experiencing the goat-pocalypse, I can press any key to stop new goats from being added to the screen, so that I regain control of the application
- As a user, I can mouseover any of these takeover goats to remove them from the screen, so that I can get back to a clear page.
